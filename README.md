## ⚙️ Included MySQL native

This project includes MySQL natively, you can enable or disable this module in `config.json`.

## 📜 Default commands available:

- 📚 **/help** Dynamically generates help message with existing commands
- ⛔ **/stop** Stops the bot *(admin command)*
- 🧪 **/test** Empty command for testing purposes *(devOnly command)*
- 🏓 **/ping** Displays bot latency (in ms)
- Example commands for various options

---

## 💡 Particularities :

- Admin category commands are not shown in /help and require being registered (Discord ID) in the `config.json` owner array 👑
- Commands marked as `devOnly: true` require being a developer to execute and should be registered in the `config.json` dev array 💻
- Configurations are cached in the client, accessible by `client.config`
- Cooldown is in seconds but resets on each bot restart; it's disabled for devOnly commands ⏱️
- You can launch the bot with `npm run dev`, in which case the bot restarts with each save you make, otherwise use `node index.js` or `npm run start`
- Buttons and commands can have categories: create a folder and place the file inside (see examples)
- Debug mode enabled by default, configuration in `.env`

## 🛠️ Command Options :

- ```userPermissions: [""]``` - Additional permissions required by the user *(default: ```sendMessages```)*
- ```botPermissions: [""]``` - Additional permissions required by the bot *(default: ```sendMessages```)*
- ```devOnly: true``` - *(default: ```false```)*
- ```cooldown: 2``` - Time (in seconds) between 2 executions of the command, in seconds *(default: ```0s```)*
- ```mp: true``` - If true, the command can be executed in DMs; if false, it can only be executed on a server *(default: ```false```)*

## 🛠️ Command Group :

- Allows you to group multiple commands under the same name, e.g., `/music on` and `/music off`
- To do this, create a folder for the sub-commands and place the files inside like normal commands (they do not have access to command options explained above)
- add ```subCommande: true``` as a parameter
- and add another command file (this one without code, so no `runInteraction` function), with:
    - The same name as the folder
    - The parameter: ```commandeGroupe: true```
    - And the parameter ```category: category```, the category you want the command to be in (leave "" if you want no category)
    - It's in this command file that you can put command options
